# Advent of Code 

https://adventofcode.com/2020/about

Another December, another AoC challenge. I am going to use languages this year that I want to learn or try out.
Most likely this will be mostly rust, but we shall see.

Due to CLions limitation of only working with cargo-based rust projects, every rust-solved day will be a cargo project.
